a game based on the shooting game last week->
I want to make a 2P game,but with the red little enemies that can get points(but they also can kill you)
one person use wasd an the other use the arrows
both people can change different gun(with different feature,e.g. reload quickly,more bullet,great power)
there will be sth. drop down and players can collect,such as add life,add points,shield
when one player die,the game end.


finish:
players
enemy
gun1
gun2
gun3
gun4
switching gun
life,score
doing:
power up
